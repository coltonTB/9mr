                  We recommend bringing:

                  <ul>
                  <li>A cart that can carry 50 pounds of groceries or more</li>
                  <li>Water to help you stay hydrated</li>
                  <li>An umbrella, in the event of inclement weather</li>
                  </ul>

                  If you are unable to visit us in person and want to request free grocery delivery, please call us at (718) 361-5454. We will get food to you, but there could be a wait of 2 to 3 weeks.

                  Expect a variety of food: raw vegetables, fresh fruit, frozen meat and cheese, canned goods, grains, and milk. Things can change based on our donation, but we are able to provide one bag from each of our sections.
